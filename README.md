# Basic SQL commands in Jupyter Notebook using IBM DB

This is the completed final assignment for IBM's SQL course.
First, I uploaded several datasets to my IBM database. Then, I used Jupyter Notebook to retrieve
certain information as stated by the exercise. This completed work was peer-reviewed on Coursera
and is fully correct. 

The included datasets were used in the exercise and do NOT belong to me. They were used in strictly
educational terms and as instructed in the IBM course on Coursera.
